        <p class="blogtext"> Welcome to the new home of I Like Pretty Clothes! I have been a happy resident of Tumblr for four and a half years, and more recently took up a second home in Instagram. But I have toyed with the idea of starting a long form blog for nearly as long as I've been taking photos of myself and sticking them on the internet, so I figured, why not do it for a course assignment and kill two birds with one stone?</p>
        <p class="blogtext">Just a little background: I've decided to make a pretty major career change, from marketing for a professional theatre to learning to programme for .. well, hopefully someone will hire when I'm well-versed in Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript and all of that fun stuff. I'm taking a course to learn this new set of skills in a really short period of time. Scary, hey?</p>
        <p class="blogtext">But even though I am learning all of this cool new stuff to become a full-fledged tech geek, don't worry - ILPC will still remain 100% devoted to my first and biggest love, pretty clothes. Ok, 99%, with some geek stuff on the side. Well, ok, 96%, because there will likely be some nerdy, tattooy and feministy stuff in there, too. Oh, and bunnies ... and ... can't forget travel! And food ... definitely food. Yummmmmmmmm, food.</p>
        <p class="blogtext"> Whatever, it will still be mostly clothes, alright?</p>
