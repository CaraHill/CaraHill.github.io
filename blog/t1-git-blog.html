        <p>
          You've just made the foray into learning programming, and have ventured into the world of git and GitHub. But what are they and how do they relate to your work as a developer?
        </p>
        <p>
            To put it simply, GitHub is a collaboration platform, a social coding website that allows developers to share their work, allow others to work on it and keep track of all changes. It's like Facebook, but instead of sharing statuses about what you had for dinner, you share code, and instead of other people liking or commenting, they can use and change your code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Github uses git for version control, to keep track of all the changes that happen to all the pieces of code developers share on the site. Git essentially lists all of the changes that have ever been made to a piece of code throughout its lifespan and manages the workflow. So lots of people can work on the same code at the same time and git will keep track of all of it - it's quite brilliant, really!
        </p>
        <h5> How do they work?</h5>
        <p>
         Git is installed locally on your computer, so whenever you want to work on something from GitHub, you create a branch (in other words, a copy, so you're not working on the original, or master) and work on it locally. Each time you make a change, you add and commit the changes, and then can push them back to the remote file on GitHub. Commits are the save points in git, and every one that is made to a piece of code can be accessed down the track. This is particularly important if a mistake is made - rather than having to go back to the beginning, you can go to the last commit, and go from there.
        </p>
        <h5> Why use them?</h5>
        <p>
          In some ways, the more important question here is why not? As a developer, particularly a newbie or student developer, GitHub is an invaluable resource to help you learn and get feedback on your work. It will help you grow into a much better programmer. It is a community of programmers who are working and sharing together, and only good things can come from that. And with git, you have a bit of an insurance policy against major mistakes; git gives you the freedom to learn.
        </p>
