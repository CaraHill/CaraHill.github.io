          Wow. A week through Phase 0, already! But it feels like it's been a long time coming for me. After watching the first three cohorts go through the process last year, I definitely agree with the kitchen analogy - from the very beginning, everyone, the students, teachers, admin and members of the larger Enspiral community, have pitched in to help create and grow the programme, and that spirit of being in it together really makes Enspiral Dev Academy what it is. It is a big part of the reason I made the decision to take the programme myself!

            I had never considered a career in programming. I have always been interested in the Arts; I studied Literature and loved to write. Although I ended up working in marketing and public relations, it's for a profressional theatre. I thought I had found my perfect career.

            When I unexpectedly started feeling like maybe it was time for a change, I still believed I would need to find a different job doing the same thing. Retraining in anything would take too long - I had already spent 7 years in tertiary education and didn't want to take too much time again. But other jobs in my field weren't appealing to me and I felt uninspired. Then my husband accepted a job as the Ruby teacher for EDA and it started to occur to me that this could be a possibility for me! A good friend of mine joined the second cohort, and I was able to get more of an idea of the experience from a student's perspective, not just a teacher's. I became sold on doing it myself.

            What appeals to me most about EDA is the culture. It's not just a programme to teach you to be a web developer, I really believe it is also a programme to teach you to be a better person. I have never come across a programme, particularly a technical programme, that focuses on the humanity as much as it does on the discipline. I believe in it, and that's why I'm changing my whole life to be a part of it. Not that it was a change I've come to lightly or quickly; I am grateful that I had a chance to watch and ask questions for months before making this commitment.

            Despite how appealing I find the prospect of EDA, I still find it scary and overwhelming. There is a LOT to take in. There will be a LOT of new experiences and many of them will be challenging. I can definitely relate to the first of the two fears: I worry that everyone will know more than me, and will question why I'm there. But I welcome the newness and the challenges, and that overrides the fear. I am excited to be a part of EDA, finally.
